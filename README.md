## About

Ian is the Cloud Lead at [Kablamo](https://www.kablamo.com.au/), a cloud product development and data consultancy specializing in building applications native to the AWS cloud. He is usually focused on cloud architecture, CI/CD and security, but is always trying out the latest AWS services. He also previously managed infrastructure at Stan, an Australian streaming service.

Between helping clients he loves the chance to build open-source projects with a focus on AWS automation and tooling. Ian built and maintains both the [Former2](https://github.com/iann0036/former2) and [Console Recorder for AWS](https://github.com/iann0036/AWSConsoleRecorder) projects, which help developers author Infrastructure as Code templates (such as CloudFormation) from existing resources or while in the AWS Management Console.

Ian also enjoys speaking at meetups, co-hosting podcasts, engaging with the community on Slack, and posting his latest experiences within AWS on his [blog](https://onecloudplease.com/blog/).
